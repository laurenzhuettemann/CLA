# Zeppelin's Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you're interested in contributing to Zeppelin, you will first need to sign a Contributor License Agreement.
This agreement gives the developer the ability to license and release your contribution in the project, and sets several expectations for both parties. You can see the full CLA in [CLA.md](./CLA.md).

## Signing the CLA

Zeppelin's CLA is signed on a per-GitHub-account basis, requiring you to reveal no personal information.

To sign the CLA, create a PR to this repository that adds a file in the `signatures` folder with your GitHub username. For example, `signatures/Dragory.md`.  
**NOTE:** [**This commit must be marked as verified by GitHub.**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) The easiest way to do this is to create the file on GitHub directly.

Within this file, include the following contents:

```
I sign the Contributor License Agreement as it is currently written in [CLA.md](../CLA.md).
```

You can see an example of this process at [#1](https://github.com/ZeppelinBot/CLA/pull/1).
